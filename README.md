# Recognition-of-Driver-behavior-using-Smartphone
The goal of this project was to build a smartphone application that can recognize hazardous behavior of a car driver. The driver actions divided into several categories and the smart scoring system recognize unsafe actions. The android application has been developed for this project using Java.

In this project we collect the sensor data and using this we are able to recognize driver actions. We consider these actions: Acceleration pattern, Turn left/right, U-Turn, Lane Change and Braking. Also, we assign a weight to each of these actions based on the sensor data. The scoring system divide the actions into two parts the normal and hazardous actions. The scoring system will alarm an unsafe action based on this score. You can see the architecture of this sytem in below picture.
